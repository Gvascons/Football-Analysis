# Football-Analysis
 
 ### The objective of this repository is to present an individual player analysis regarding brazilian first division championship teams.
 
 ### The relative data collected for this analysis, altogether with the code/method used for excration (Scrapy), is available for use. Special thanks to https://fbref.com/pt/comps/24/Serie-A-Estatisticas for providing the data.
 
 #### Since the scope of this repository is not directly related to web scraping, we only assumed the use of the Scrapy framework to gather the necessary data. Although the code used for scraping is available in this project, we will not cover it's usage.

##### The code can be found at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IRzEgXl5O9Bae-FIIZBKDdZ5_MR-ijgz.

##### Youtube link regarding the first track of this project is https://youtu.be/EgKPyh5NMVk (We are sorry for the bad audio. We intend to record a new video to fix that).
